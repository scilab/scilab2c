RN - Clearly specify what the "find" function may return
BJ   Position in array AND/OR Value.

BJ - Bench cosh Vs cosh explicit formula.
     Bench asinh Vs asinh explicit formula.

BJ - Bench for precision between F77 and C Math lib.
     For example : atan2 / log1p

BJ - 'atan2' is not available in Scilab...

BJ - Bench Encapsulation vs. Direct function call

BJ - Enlarge tests.

BJ - Released functions :
     + acos   : [done R and C]
     + acosh  : [done R and C]
     + asin   : [done R and C]
     + asinh  : [done R and C]
     + atan   : [done R and C]
     + cos    :	[done R and C]
     + exp10  :	!! FIXME !!
     + log    : [done R and C] --> Need Testing
     + log10  : [done R and C] --> Need Testing
     + log1p  :
     + sin    : [done R and C]
     + sinh   : [done R and C]
     + sqrt   : [done R and C] --> Need Testing

** ATAN has some diff with Scilab.
** EXP10 Does not exists in Scilab. See HAT

AT - Convol with 3 input arguments

AT - FFT and IFFT with 3 input arguments

AT - Functions max and min might not have all prototypes they could have in the INIT file.

AT - FFT and IFFT : need to change Output type

AT - Scilab2CDeps.sci : data have changed and file hasn't been updated. To Update.

AT - Interface for rand
BJ - Test rand

BJ - Interface frexp within INIT file.

AT - Functions zeros(), ones(), rand(), eye() return error during generation code
	See Available functions : d0zeros is available instead of zerosd0
	
AT - Manage implicitList with complex input arguments : see size declaration in C-Code

AT - Tests for squareMagnitude

AT - Tests for LDivision : see test file

AT - Test for Jmat is empty (but function is unused and not asked)

AT - Tests for lpc2cep

AT - Tests for prod : these are calculation of absolute precision and not relative

AT - Complete max and min prototypes in INIT_Fill..., miss d2d2...d2
