RN - Clearly specify what the "find" function may return
BJ   Position in array AND/OR Value.

BJ - Bench Cosh Vs . Cosh explicit formula.

BJ - Bench for precision between F77 and C Math lib.
     For example : atan2 / log1p

BJ - 'atan2' is not available in Scilab...

BJ - Bench Encapsulation vs. Direct function call

BJ - Enlarge tests.

BJ - Released functions :
     + acos   : [done R and C]
     + acosh  : [done R and C]
     
AT - Convol with 3 input arguments

AT - FFT and IFFT with 3 input arguments
     
AT - Functions max and min might not have all prototypes they could have in the INIT file.

AT - FFT and IFFT : need to change Output type

AT - Scilab2CDeps.sci : data have changed and file hasn't been updated. To Update.
