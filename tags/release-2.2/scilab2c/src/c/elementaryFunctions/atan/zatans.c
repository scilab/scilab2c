  CHANGES : - (Bruno on 2001 May 22) for ysptrk use a
  minimax polynome to enlarge the special
  evaluation zone |s| < SLIM. Also rename
  this function as lnp1m1.
  - (Bruno on 2001 June 7) better handling
  of spurious over/underflow ; remove
  the call to pythag ; better accuracy
  in the real part for z near +-i

  EXTERNALS FUNCTIONS

  lnp1m1  (at the end of this file)

  ALGORITHM : noting z = a + i*b, we have:
  Z = yr + yi*b = arctan(z) = (i/2) * log( (i+z)/(i-z) )

  This function has two branch points at +i and -i and the
  chosen  branch cuts are the two half-straight lines
  D1 = [i, i*oo) and D2 = (-i*oo, i].  The function is then
  analytic in C \ (D1 U D2)).

  From the definition it follows that:

  yr = 0.5 Arg ( (i+z)/(i-z) )                   (1)
  yi = 0.5 log (|(i+z)/(i-z)|)                   (2)

  so lim (z -> +- i) yr = undefined (and Nan is logical)
  lim (z -> +i)   yi = +oo
  lim (z -> -i)   yi = -oo

  The real part of arctan(z) is discontinuous across D1 and D2
  and we impose the following definitions:
  if imag(z) > 1 then
  Arg(arctan(z)) =  pi/2 (=lim real(z) -> 0+)
  if imag(z) < 1 then
  Arg(arctan(z)) = -pi/2 (=lim real(z) -> 0-)


  Basic evaluation: if we write (i+z)/(i-z) using
  z = a + i*b, we get:

  i+z    1-(a**2+b**2) + i*(2a)
  --- =  ----------------------
  i-z       a**2 + (1-b)**2

  then, with r2 = |z|^2 = a**2 + b**2 :

  yr = 0.5 * Arg(1-r2 + (2*a)*i)
  = 0.5 * atan2(2a, (1-r2))                      (3)

  This formula is changed when r2 > RMAX (max pos float)
  and also when |1-r2| and |a| are near 0 (see comments
  in the code).

  After some math:

  yi = 0.25 * log( (a**2 + (b + 1)**2) /
  (a**2 + (b - 1)**2) )            (4)

  Evaluation for "big" |z|
  ------------------------

  If |z| is "big", the direct evaluation of yi by (4) may
  suffer of innaccuracies and of spurious overflow.  Noting
  that  s = 2 b / (1 + |z|**2), we have:

  yi = 0.25 log ( (1 + s)/(1 - s) )                 (5)

  3        5
  yi = 0.25*( 2 * ( s + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s  + ... ))

  yi = 0.25 * lnp1m1(s)    if  |s| < SLIM

  So if |s| is less than SLIM we switch to a special
  evaluation done by the function lnp1m1. The
  threshold value SLIM is choosen by experiment
  (with the Pari-gp software). For |s|
  "very small" we used a truncated taylor dvp,
  else a minimax polynome (see lnp1m1).

  To avoid spurious overflows (which result in spurious
  underflows for s) in computing s with s= 2 b / (1 + |z|**2)
  when |z|^2 > RMAX (max positive float) we use :

  s = 2d0 / ( (a/b)*a + b )

  but if |b| = Inf  this formula leads to NaN when
  |a| is also Inf. As we have :

  |s| <= 2 / |b|

  we impose simply : s = 0  when |b| = Inf

  Evaluation for z very near to i or -i:
  --------------------------------------
  Floating point numbers of the form a+i or a-i with 0 <
  a**2 < tiny (approximately 1d-308) may lead to underflow
  (i.e., a**2 = 0) and the logarithm will break formula (4).
  So we switch to the following formulas:

  If b = +-1 and |a| < sqrt(tiny) approximately 1d-150 (say)
  then (by using that a**2 + 4 = 4 in machine for such a):

  yi = 0.5 * log( 2/|a| )   for b=1

  yi = 0.5 * log( |a|/2 )   for b=-1

  finally: yi = 0.5 * sign(b) * log( 2/|a| )
  yi = 0.5 * sign(b) * (log(2) - log(|a|)) (6)

  The last trick is to avoid overflow for |a|=tiny!  In fact
  this formula may be used until a**2 + 4 = 4 so that the
  threshold value may be larger.
